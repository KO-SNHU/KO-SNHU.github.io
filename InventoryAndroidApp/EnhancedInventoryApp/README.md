# The Enhanced Inventory App!
This Inventory App was originally my final project from my CS 360 class. The files you see here are the updated files which now included added security measures
that were not included in the original version.
Addtional updates to the new Inventory App include the following:
*	Add SHA-256 hashing for user passwords for increased security measures.
*	Add SQL Injection protection on queries.
*	Enhanced code to include try catch blocks on relevant code.
*	Updated comments to be more readable and maintainable.

# Running the Code!
I ran this code in Android Studio with a standard Smartphone Emulator to test the app.
