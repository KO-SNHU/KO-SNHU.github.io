# Greetings and Salutations!
My name is Kristie O'Brien and it is my honor to have you visit this site! Here you will find what has been my final work in my Bachelor Degree
of Computer Science at Southern New Hampshire University, or what we students affectionately call our alma mater, SNHU. Over the course of my time here at SNHU, I have obtained two degrees, one in Mathematics and the other in Computer Science.

The work you see presented here is not just the culmination of the last eight weeks of work in my final class here at SNHU. It is the result of several years of dedicated study across not one, but two degrees. My first degree, also obtained at SNHU is a Bachelor Degree in Mathematics. During the pursuit of that degree, I also learned many valuable skills that taught me about the importance of topics related to computer science, One such topic I learned in detail about studying mathematics was algorithms and how algorithms did not just have their advent with the dawn of computer science. 
Additionally, the study of math also showed me various ways encryption and decryption skills can be used to secure information. I learned this most poignantly in my Mathematics Course on Cryptography here at SNHU. While this course did not present the idea of encryption and cyphers from strictly a computer science standpoint, it did present some of the key concepts as well as the foundational math skills that now allow me to apply encryption techniques to computational security issues.

Meanwhile, the study of computer science has taught me about the importance of technology in our everyday lives, culture, and advancement of technology. Certain mathematical simulations that can be done by hand take significantly less time when done in a computer science setting. I found this to be true time and again throughout my coursework with one such example shown here in the artifacts that will be presented today. In the Text Based Game artifact, a user must collect items with various point value assignments in order to beat the game. Depending on the number of points a user has collected will depend on their game output. The math is simple addition and subtraction. However, this math must account for every possible player outcome. This could take great time if it were done by hand. As such, running these calculations through the program allows for the results to be tabulated nearly instantly.

Considering all of the above, one can see how intrinsically tied together the study of mathematics and computer science are to each other. It is for this reason I chose to pair together these degrees in order that one could inform the other which would serve to strengthen my abilities in both. Doing so has allowed me to enhance my understanding of algorithms, security structures, engineering, problem solving, and creativity. All of these skills are ones that I deliberately sought to hone in order to enter into the professional workplace. As such, these skills also speak directly to my professional goals. My key professional goal that has driven much of my studies has been to combine mathematics and computer science in such a way that I can provide a holistic and synergistic mindset and approach towards problem solving. Mathematics provides me with the skills to understand the pure numerical, algorithmic, and dynamic application and theory of many computer science problems. My understanding of computer science gives me tools and resources to see these problems solved in manners that are beneficial to the customer and programmer alike. For instance, I could provide a written algorithm working through a numerical problem, but such an algorithm only works for the problem its solved. I could then program that algorithm to take in user input and solve any problem related to that algorithm the user wished to solve. This combination of computer science and mathematics then leads to a wider range of more accessible solutions. Therefore, I provide a unique understanding of these two worlds which makes me a stronger programmer, mathematician, and even engineer. 


# Code Review
First things first, it is hard to enhance a coding artifact without first knowing where you stand with the existing code. In the following video, you can see my play by play walkthrough of hte three existing coding projects as they were when I turned them in as final projects for various classes throughout my Computer Science program. In this video I go over the following key criteria to evaluate how well the existing artifacts function and meet modern computer science standards.
* Structure
* Documentation
* Variables
* Arithmetic Operations
* Loops and Branches
* Defensive Programming
