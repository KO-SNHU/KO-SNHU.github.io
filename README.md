# Greetings and Salutations!
My name is Kristie O'Brien and it is my honor to have you visit this site! Here you will find what has been my final work in my Bachelor Degree
of Computer Science at Southern New Hampshire University, or what we students affectionately call our alma mater, SNHU. Over the course of my time here at SNHU, I have obtained two degrees, one in Mathematics and the other in Computer Science.

# A Study on Mathematics and Computer Science
The work you see presented here is not just the culmination of the last eight weeks of work in my final class here at SNHU. It is the result of several years of dedicated study across not one, but two degrees. My first degree, also obtained at SNHU is a Bachelor Degree in Mathematics. During the pursuit of that degree, I also learned many valuable skills that taught me about the importance of topics related to computer science, One such topic I learned in detail about studying mathematics was algorithms and how algorithms did not just have their advent with the dawn of computer science. 
Additionally, the study of math also showed me various ways encryption and decryption skills can be used to secure information. I learned this most poignantly in my Mathematics Course on Cryptography here at SNHU. While this course did not present the idea of encryption and cyphers from strictly a computer science standpoint, it did present some of the key concepts as well as the foundational math skills that now allow me to apply encryption techniques to computational security issues.

Meanwhile, the study of computer science has taught me about the importance of technology in our everyday lives, culture, and advancement of technology. Certain mathematical simulations that can be done by hand take significantly less time when done in a computer science setting. I found this to be true time and again throughout my coursework with one such example shown here in the artifacts that will be presented today. In the Text Based Game artifact, a user must collect items with various point value assignments in order to beat the game. Depending on the number of points a user has collected will depend on their game output. The math is simple addition and subtraction. However, this math must account for every possible player outcome. This could take great time if it were done by hand. As such, running these calculations through the program allows for the results to be tabulated nearly instantly.

Considering all of the above, one can see how intrinsically tied together the study of mathematics and computer science are to each other. It is for this reason I chose to pair together these degrees in order that one could inform the other which would serve to strengthen my abilities in both. Doing so has allowed me to enhance my understanding of algorithms, security structures, engineering, problem solving, and creativity. All of these skills are ones that I deliberately sought to hone in order to enter into the professional workplace. As such, these skills also speak directly to my professional goals. My key professional goal that has driven much of my studies has been to combine mathematics and computer science in such a way that I can provide a holistic and synergistic mindset and approach towards problem solving. Mathematics provides me with the skills to understand the pure numerical, algorithmic, and dynamic application and theory of many computer science problems. My understanding of computer science gives me tools and resources to see these problems solved in manners that are beneficial to the customer and programmer alike. For instance, I could provide a written algorithm working through a numerical problem, but such an algorithm only works for the problem its solved. I could then program that algorithm to take in user input and solve any problem related to that algorithm the user wished to solve. This combination of computer science and mathematics then leads to a wider range of more accessible solutions. Therefore, I provide a unique understanding of these two worlds which makes me a stronger programmer, mathematician, and even engineer.

Something that SNHU puts a high importance on is the understanding that we as students are not just learning, we are preparing to be useful and productive members of our chosen fields. As such, many SNHU classes are project based and meant to simulate projects we as students may encounter in the real world. This, in my own experience, has involved drafting proposals, presenting findings on computational solutions, writing security standards documents, collaborating with professors and fellow classmates, and much more. Over the course of my program, I learned about communicating complex technical findings with a diverse audience who may have a varied background of technical knowledge. This is a skill I have carried with me throughout every class I have taken at SNHU and into my professional real world experiences whether it be in a written form or live presentation. For example, in my Secure Coding Course at SNHU, I had to learn several aspects of secure coding, such as protection against SQL Injection attacks, protection against inherent flaws in a code, and much more. However, in addition to these skills, I also worked to draft a secure coding document such that the standards I wrote could be adopted by a company for future use. This then involved my presenting these standards and their relevant application in a simulated live presentation setting to an audience of stakeholders. Other classes I have taken at SNHU follow similar formats with some including classmate collaborations where we could practice defending our work through live questions and answers.

# Code Review
First things first, it is hard to enhance a coding artifact without first knowing where you stand with the existing code. In the following video, you can see my play by play walkthrough of hte three existing coding projects as they were when I turned them in as final projects for various classes throughout my Computer Science program. In this video I go over the following key criteria to evaluate how well the existing artifacts function and meet modern computer science standards.
* Structure
* Documentation
* Variables
* Arithmetic Operations
* Loops and Branches
* Defensive Programming

# Introduction to the Artifacts
To showcase some of the skills mentioned above, I have compiled the artifacts that you can find later in this page. These three artifacts all began as final projects in courses throughout my computer science program here at SNHU. Having reached the end of the Computer Science program though, a time of reflection was called for to look back on these past assignments and see them in the light of all I had learned. In doing so, I saw there was much room for improvement for these artifacts. 

# Software Engineering
The first artifact, the Text Based Game, was actually one of my first ever computer science projects. In its original form, it was a basic text based game that allowed a user to navigate a map that they could not see to collect a set amount of items in order to defeat a villain located in the map. This was a fun challenge for an early computer science student. However, a new range of complexity could for sure be added and that is what I did. The enhanced Text Based Game now allows the user to choose their difficulty level with the easy level allowing users to see the map and start with a helpful item in their inventory. The hard level is basically the same as the original game, however, there are added complex elements to the base game. These new complex elements include hidden items, items that can negate other items in the userâ€™s inventory, items that can be crafted, and a secret ending that can only be achieved if the user has accomplished certain tasks. These additions allow for a more accessible user experience, which enables the game to reach a wider audience. Furthermore, the coding upgrades include enhanced error handling, more complex dictionaries, and image processing. All of these skills work together to inform a comprehensive software engineering solution to a problem.

# Algorithms and Data Structures
The second artifact, the Course Planner, was another early computer science project for me. As such, the original form this project took did not consider computational complexity at all. I used a vector data structure and vector sorting algorithms which resulted in an overall runtime complexity of O(n). The purpose of this artifact is to read in a datafile of course information, display it alphanumerically, and print information requested by the user. Therefore, I knew there was a way I could significantly reduce the complexity of the runtime. Rather than using a vector sorting algorithm, I implemented an unordered map system to search for the course information stored in the unordered map. This reduced the course lookup logic to O(1) complexity rather than O(n).
