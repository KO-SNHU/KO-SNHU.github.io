# The Course Planner!
This Course Planner is from Project Two from my CS 300 class. The files you see here are the original unchanged files where the complexity is still O(n) rather than O(1).

# Running The Code!
I ran this code in Visual Studio. It is important that the Courses.txt file be placed in the same folder as the proejct so that it can access the folder.
