# The Updated Course Planner!
This is the Updated Course Planner where the original was from Project Two from my CS 300 class. This is the Updated Course Planner where the coruse lookup functionality is now O(1)
rather than the original O(n).

Addtional updates to the new Course Planner include the following:
* UserRun function and UserRunTwo function condensed to one function.
* Comments have been cleaned up and made more reader and writer friendly for enhanced maintainability.
* An unordered map was used rather than a vector data structure.

# Running The Code!
I ran this code in Visual Studio. It is important that the Courses.txt file be placed in the same folder as the proejct so that it can access the folder.
